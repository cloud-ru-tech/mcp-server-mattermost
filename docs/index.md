# MCP Server Mattermost

Let AI assistants read, search, and post in your Mattermost workspace.

## What You Can Do

Once configured, ask your AI assistant:

- "Catch me up on #backend — what happened while I was away?"
- "Find unanswered questions in #support and post a summary"
- "Set up a channel for the new project, invite the team, post the goals"
- "We shipped v2.1.0 — gather changes from #dev and post release notes"
